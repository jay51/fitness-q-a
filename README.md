### contribute
- Clone or Fork repo
- `cd` into repo and install dependencies `npm i`
- start mongo if you have it installed, otherwise use docker
  - First install docker for your system [install Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-getting-started) 
  - Second build an image out of the docker file in the repo -> `cd` into the rep folder and type `docker build .`
  - Start a container out of the new built image -> type `docker run -d  -p 27017:27017 --name mongoDB mongo`
  - Next time you need to start the mongo container just type `docker start mongoDB` and type `docker stope mongoDB` to shut it down
- To start the app type `npm start`

> **Note**: To access mongoDB shell, type `docker exec -it mongoDB /bin/bash`. This will put you inside the docker container and then type `mongo` to run the mongo shell.
